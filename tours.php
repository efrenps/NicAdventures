			        	We will pick you up from your hotel and head to Granada for a city tour and boat tour of the Granada Islets, These are a group of 365 small islands scattered about the Asese peninsula. The islets are of volcanic origin, they were formed when the Mombacho Volcano blew much of its cone into the lake thousands of years ago, thereby creating the archipelago. Most of islets are covered with vegetation and rich with bird life. Many of the islets are occupied. Some are privately owned and hold homes or vacation houses. Then we will head to Masaya Volcano for an incredible adventure, the main area of interest here is the massive Santiago crater that was been created between the Nindiri and Masaya volcanoes. Eruptions took place frequently during the 1900's until the crater eventually collapsed in 1985. The result is bellowing sulphurous gases and the sound of thunderous lava flows rocketing beneath the crater hole. The tour starts with a visit to the cross (La Cruz de Bobadilla) overlooking the volcano and the surroundings. Next you see the magnificent Green Parakeets that return to the volcano every night to roost. These birds have somehow become adapted to the sulphuric fumes expelled from the volcano and actually live within the crater. You also observe a large number of bats departing their caves, another great natural spectacle, then proceed to an underground tunnel that has formed by streams of lava. Equipped with flashlight and helmet, you can enter the tunnel and observe the interesting rock formations. The trip ends with a visit to a viewpoint that provides the opportunity to look inside the crater mouth of the volcano, observing the glowing lava. We will then drof you off at your hotel.

			        	We will pick you up from your hotel and head to Granada for a city tour, Granada is a city in western Nicaragua and the capital of the Granada Department. With an estimated population of 117,569 (2007), it is Nicaragua's sixth most populous city. Granada is historically one of Nicaragua's most important cities, economically and politically. It has a rich colonial heritage, seen in its architecture and structure. Granada was founded in 1524 by Francisco HernÃ¡ndez de CÃ³rdoba, ostensibly the first European city in mainland America. Unlike other cities that claim the same distinction, the city of Granada was not only the settlement of the conquest, but also a city registered in official records of the Crown of Aragon, and the Kingdom of Castle in Spain. Granada is also known as La Gran Sultana, in reflection of its Moorish and Andalusian appearance, unlike its sister city of LeÃ³n and historical rival, which displays Castilian trends. It was named by HernÃ¡ndez de CÃ³rdoba after the ancient Spanish city of Granada. This was done in honor of the defeat of the last Moorish stronghold, which had been Spanish Granada, by the Catholic King and Queen of Spain. Granada, Nicaragua was historically the sister capital in Central America to Antigua, Guatemala. During the colonial period, Granada maintained a flourishing level of commerce with ports on the Atlantic Ocean, through Lake Nicaragua (a.k.a. Cocibolca) and the San Juan River. After the city tour of Granada we will take a tour of the Granada Islets, these are a group of 365 small islands scattered about the Asese peninsula. The islets are of volcanic origin, they were formed when the Mombacho Volcano blew much of its cone into the lake thousands of years ago, thereby creating the archipelago. Most of islets are covered with vegetation and rich with bird life. Many of the islets are occupied. Some are privately owned and hold homes or vacation houses.
